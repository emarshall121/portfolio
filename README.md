# Personal Work Portfolio

This challenge required me to create a web application from scratch which could be use as a portfolio to showcase myself and my work for future employers. Throughout this challenge I used the knowledge I have gained over the last two weeks and incorporated my knowledge of HTML, CSS, CSS Grid, flexbox, responsive layout design, organization and styling of code, and more.
